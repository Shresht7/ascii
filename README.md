# `ascii`

An ASCII lookup command-line-interface.

**American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)** is a character-encoding standard that assigns a unique number rainging from 0 to 127 to letters, digits, and symbols. For example, uppercase 'A' is represented by the decimal `65` (or `1000001` in binary). It is a 7-bit encoding system based on the English alphabet representing upto 128 characters.

In digital communication, computers process information in binary code (`0`s and `1`s). ASCII values serve as a bridge between human-readable text and computer-readable binary code. It includes:

- **control characters**: 0-31 and 127
    - `NUL` (Null Character): 0
    - `LF` (Line Feed): 10
    - `DEL` (Delete) 127
- **printable characters**: 32-126
    - `A` (Uppercase A): 65
    - `B` (Uppercase B): 66
    - `a` (Lowercase a): 97
    - ` ` (Space): 32
    - `5` (Number 5): 53
    - `7` (Number 7): 55
    - `!` (Exclamation Mark): 33

> **Note**
>
> The tool only considers the first character of the argument.
